        <div class="critical-box">
            <strong>IMPORTANT - MANDATORY READING:</strong> This Refund Policy forms an integral part of the Terms and Conditions governing your use of Laddoo App. By using the App and initiating any transaction, you unconditionally accept, acknowledge, and agree to be bound by this Refund Policy in its entirety. This policy contains strict limitations and exclusions regarding refund eligibility. Failure to read or understand this policy shall not constitute grounds for any dispute, claim, or refund request.
        </div>

        <h2>1. SCOPE AND APPLICATION</h2>
        <p><strong>1.1</strong> This Refund Policy applies to all recharge transactions processed through the Laddoo App.</p>
        
        <p><strong>1.2</strong> This policy outlines the exhaustive and exclusive circumstances under which refunds may or may not be processed.</p>

        <p><strong>1.3</strong> Any scenario not explicitly listed as "refundable" shall be deemed non-refundable by default.</p>

        <h2>2. FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES</h2>
        <div class="highlight-box">
            <p><strong>2.1 User Responsibility:</strong> Users bear the sole, absolute, and exclusive responsibility for verifying the accuracy of all transaction details (including mobile number, recharge amount, and operator selection) BEFORE confirming any transaction.</p>

            <p><strong>2.2 Transaction Finality:</strong> Once a transaction is processed and marked as "SUCCESSFUL" by the system, it is considered final, binding, and irreversible.</p>

            <p><strong>2.3 Third-Party Processing:</strong> Recharge transactions are processed through third-party Telecom Operators and payment gateways over which the Company has no control after submission.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>3. REFUND ELIGIBLE SCENARIOS (EXHAUSTIVE LIST)</h2>
        <div class="critical-box">
            <strong>ONLY THE FOLLOWING SCENARIOS ARE ELIGIBLE FOR REFUND:</strong> Refunds shall ONLY be processed in the following specific circumstances and in no other circumstances whatsoever:
        </div>

        <h3>3.1 Failed Transaction Due to Technical Error</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Condition:</strong> The transaction was debited from the User's payment method BUT the recharge was NOT credited to ANY mobile number due to technical failure, system malfunction, or Telecom Operator rejection;</li>
            <li><strong>Verification:</strong> Subject to verification through transaction logs and Telecom Operator confirmation;</li>
            <li><strong>Processing Time:</strong> Automatic refund within 5-7 business days to the original payment method;</li>
            <li><strong>Notification:</strong> User will receive automated notification upon refund initiation;</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3.2 Duplicate Charging for Single Transaction</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Condition:</strong> The User was charged multiple times (double debit or more) for a single recharge transaction due to system error or payment gateway malfunction;</li>
            <li><strong>Evidence Required:</strong> Bank statement or payment confirmation showing multiple debits for the same transaction reference number;</li>
            <li><strong>Processing:</strong> The duplicate charge(s) will be refunded within 5-7 business days after verification;</li>
            <li><strong>Limitation:</strong> Only the excess amount (duplicate charges) will be refunded; the legitimate transaction amount is non-refundable;</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3.3 Unauthorized Transaction Due to System Breach</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Condition:</strong> Transaction was initiated without User's authorization due to security breach or system vulnerability on the Company's end;</li>
            <li><strong>Reporting Requirement:</strong> Must be reported within 24 hours of occurrence;</li>
            <li><strong>Investigation:</strong> Subject to thorough investigation and verification by the Company's security team;</li>
            <li><strong>Cooperation Required:</strong> User must fully cooperate with investigation including providing FIR copy if requested;</li>
            <li><strong>Processing:</strong> Refund processed within 10-14 business days upon confirmation of unauthorized access;</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3.4 System Error Resulting in Wrong Amount Deduction</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Condition:</strong> The Company's system deducted a higher amount than the recharge amount selected by the User due to technical malfunction;</li>
            <li><strong>Verification:</strong> Must be verified through system logs showing discrepancy between selected amount and charged amount;</li>
            <li><strong>Processing:</strong> Excess amount refunded within 5-7 business days;</li>
            <li><strong>Note:</strong> This does NOT apply to User error in selecting wrong amount;</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. STRICTLY NON-REFUNDABLE SCENARIOS (EXHAUSTIVE LIST)</h2>
        <div class="critical-box">
            <strong>ABSOLUTELY NO REFUNDS SHALL BE PROVIDED IN THE FOLLOWING CIRCUMSTANCES:</strong>
            <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">The following scenarios are STRICTLY and ABSOLUTELY NON-REFUNDABLE under any circumstances, without any exceptions:</p>
        </div>

        <h3>4.1 User Error - Wrong Mobile Number</h3>
        <div class="critical-box">
            <ul style="margin-top: 1rem;">
                <li><strong>Scenario:</strong> User entered an incorrect, invalid, or unintended mobile number and the recharge was SUCCESSFULLY processed and credited to that number;</li>
                <li><strong>Reasoning:</strong> The recharge has been successfully delivered to the entered mobile number; the telecom operator has processed and accepted the recharge;</li>
                <li><strong>User Responsibility:</strong> It is the User's sole responsibility to verify the mobile number before confirming the transaction;</li>
                <li><strong>No Reversal:</strong> Once credited to a mobile number, the Company has no technical or legal ability to reverse the recharge from the Telecom Operator;</li>
                <li><strong>No Exceptions:</strong> No refund shall be provided regardless of User's explanation, circumstances, or hardship;</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h3>4.2 User Error - Wrong Recharge Amount</h3>
        <div class="critical-box">
            <ul style="margin-top: 1rem;">
                <li><strong>Scenario:</strong> User selected, entered, or confirmed an incorrect recharge amount (higher or lower than intended) and the transaction was successfully processed;</li>
                <li><strong>Reasoning:</strong> The User explicitly selected and confirmed the amount before payment;</li>
                <li><strong>Confirmation Required:</strong> All transactions require User confirmation, indicating deliberate selection;</li>
                <li><strong>Non-Refundable:</strong> Whether the amount is INR 10 or INR 10,000, if successfully recharged, it is non-refundable;</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h3>4.3 User Error - Wrong Operator Selection</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Scenario:</strong> User selected an incorrect Telecom Operator and the recharge was successfully processed;</li>
            <li><strong>Reasoning:</strong> The recharge has been accepted and processed by the selected operator;</li>
            <li><strong>Auto-Detection:</strong> While the App provides operator auto-detection, final responsibility lies with the User to verify before confirmation;</li>
            <li><strong>Non-Refundable:</strong> Successfully processed recharges to wrong operators are not eligible for refund;</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4.4 Change of Mind / Buyer's Remorse</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Scenario:</strong> User completed a successful transaction but later decides they no longer want the recharge;</li>
            <li><strong>Reasoning:</strong> Digital goods, once delivered, cannot be "returned" like physical products;</li>
            <li><strong>Non-Refundable:</strong> All successful transactions are final and binding;</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4.5 Successful Recharge - Any Circumstance</h3>
        <div class="critical-box">
            <ul style="margin-top: 1rem;">
                <li><strong>Fundamental Rule:</strong> If the recharge was successfully processed and credited to ANY mobile number (whether correct or incorrect), NO REFUND shall be provided under any circumstances;</li>
                <li><strong>Successful Transaction Definition:</strong> A transaction where the Telecom Operator confirms acceptance and credit of the recharge amount;</li>
                <li><strong>Irreversibility:</strong> Successful recharges cannot be reversed due to technical and regulatory limitations;</li>
                <li><strong>Absolute Policy:</strong> This is an absolute, non-negotiable policy with zero exceptions;</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h3>4.6 Delay in Operator Processing</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Scenario:</strong> Recharge is marked successful but there is delay in credit by the Telecom Operator;</li>
            <li><strong>Reasoning:</strong> The Company has fulfilled its obligation by transmitting the recharge to the operator;</li>
            <li><strong>Operator Responsibility:</strong> Credit delays are the responsibility of the Telecom Operator;</li>
            <li><strong>No Refund:</strong> Delayed credit does not qualify for refund; Users should contact the Telecom Operator directly;</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4.7 Promotional or Discounted Transactions</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Scenario:</strong> Transactions completed using promotional codes, discounts, or special offers;</li>
            <li><strong>Reasoning:</strong> Special promotional transactions are subject to additional restrictions;</li>
            <li><strong>Non-Refundable:</strong> Unless explicitly stated otherwise in the promotion terms;</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4.8 Cashback Already Earned or Utilized</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Scenario:</strong> User has received and scratched the cashback scratch card for the transaction;</li>
            <li><strong>Reasoning:</strong> User has already obtained value from the transaction through cashback;</li>
            <li><strong>Policy:</strong> Even in eligible refund cases, cashback earned will be deducted from refund amount;</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4.9 Late Refund Requests</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Time Limit:</strong> Refund requests must be submitted within 7 days of the transaction date;</li>
            <li><strong>Strict Enforcement:</strong> Requests submitted after 7 days are automatically rejected;</li>
            <li><strong>No Extensions:</strong> No extensions or exceptions to the 7-day limit;</li>
            <li><strong>Reasoning:</strong> Allows timely investigation and resolution;</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4.10 Telecom Operator Policies and Validity Issues</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Scenario:</strong> Issues arising from Telecom Operator's policies, plan changes, validity periods, or service terms;</li>
            <li><strong>Reasoning:</strong> The Company is not responsible for operator-specific policies;</li>
            <li><strong>Direct Resolution:</strong> Users must resolve such issues directly with their Telecom Operator;</li>
            <li><strong>Non-Refundable:</strong> Operator policy issues do not qualify for refund from the Company;</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4.11 Third-Party Payment Gateway Issues</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Scenario:</strong> Issues arising from payment gateway processing, bank declines after initial authorization, or payment method limitations;</li>
            <li><strong>Reasoning:</strong> If recharge was successfully processed, payment gateway issues are between User and their bank;</li>
            <li><strong>Exception:</strong> Only if amount was debited but recharge completely failed (see Section 3.1);</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4.12 Force Majeure Events</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Scenario:</strong> Transactions affected by events beyond the Company's control including natural disasters, wars, government actions, strikes, or internet outages;</li>
            <li><strong>Reasoning:</strong> The Company cannot be held liable for force majeure events;</li>
            <li><strong>Assessment:</strong> Each case assessed individually; generally non-refundable if recharge was successfully processed;</li>
        </ul>
